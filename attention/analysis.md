# Analysis

## Layer 3, Head 8
This head appears to focus on understanding the relationship between nouns and the verbs that reference or act upon them. In the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the little [MASK]," the verb "jumps" strongly attends to the noun "fox," indicating that this head is capturing the action's subject. This pattern of attention between verbs and the nouns they act upon is similar to verb-noun pairs in other sentences.

Example Sentences:
- "The quick brown fox jumps over the little [MASK]."
- "A large green [MASK] fell from the tree."

## Layer 2, Head 4

This head seems to capture relationships between adverbs and verbs in a sentence. For example, in the sentence "She [MASK] fast," the token "fast" strongly attends to the verb "moves" (predicted by the model). This pattern is also observed in other sentences with adverb-verb pairs.

Example Sentences:
- "She [MASK] fast."
- "The bird [MASK] high."
